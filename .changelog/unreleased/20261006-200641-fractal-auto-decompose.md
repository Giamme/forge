Fractal can now decide at every eligible node whether to split the work or implement it directly: `--fractal-auto-decompose` turns it on (opt-in; without it Fractal behaves as before) and `--fractal-planner <spec>` picks a separate model for those decisions. The planning decisions show up in reports.
